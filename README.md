# readMe-Generator

## Description
A command-line application that dynamically generates a high-quality, professional README markdown file. The content of the README is generated from the users input using the inquirer package. The app accomplishes this by prompting the user with questions pertaining to their project in the command-line. Once the user answers all of the questions, a new markdown file will be created in the current directory, containing a polished README that includes project title, description, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributors, tests, and contact info.

## Installation
This application requires the user to have node.js installed to work. Next, the user needs to install the app's packages by running 'npm install' in the command line in their terminal. Finally, to run the application itself, the user will need to run the command 'node index.js'. At this point the user answers the prompts given in the command line.

## Usage
Below is a video walkthrough that shows the functionality of this application:
